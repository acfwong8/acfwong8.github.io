This is what your post will look like. I will even link an image below.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TN_markus_500x500px.jpg)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
